<p align="center"><strong>Beautiful screen recordings with zoom animation.<br>Simple, open-source alternative to Screen.studio.</strong></p>


If you don't want to pay $29/month for Screen Studio but want a much simpler version that does what most people seem to need, making beautiful product demos and walkthroughs, here's a free-to-use app for you. OpenScreen does not offer all Screen Studio features, but covers the basics well!


OpenScreen is 100% free for personal and commercial use. Use it, modify it, distribute it. (Just be cool 😁 and give a shoutout if you feel like it !)



**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This is very much in <span style="display: inline-block; background: transparent; color: #111; font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: 400; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #111; padding: 0px 5px; margin-right: 2px; vertical-align: middle;">beta</span> and might be buggy here and there (but hope you have a good experience!).**

## Core Features
- Record your whole screen or specific apps
- Add manual zooms (customizable depth levels)
- Customize the duration and position of zooms however you please
- Crop video recordings to hide parts
- Choose between wallpapers, solid colors, or gradients for your background
- Motion blur and exponential easing for smoother pan and zoom effects

**Note:**
- OpenScreen is designed to support both Windows and macOS. We did not use any native APIs specific to one OS, so it should work on both. However, it hasn't been fully tested on Windows yet, if you run into issues, please let me know!
- After you install the app, you'll need to grant it accessibility and screen recording permissions for it to work properly.

**Contribution:**
Planning to add a contribution guide soon so people can contribute to this repo. Stay tuned!
